## Jewellery Shop

## Overview 
This project is a jewellery shop backend application built with Express.js and MongoDB. It includes functionalities for user authentication, managing customer records, and handling various jewellery-related data:

## Features

- User Authentication: Secure endpoints using JWT for token-based authentication.
- Customer Management: CRUD operations for managing customer data, including the ability to create, read, update, and delete customer records.
- Location Data: Store and manage location information as part of customer records

## Technology Stack
- Backend Framework: Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Utility: UUID for generating unique IDs

## Instructions
ðŸ’»   
### Prerequisites
- Node.js 
- MongoDB 
- Postman (for testing endpoints)

### Setup
1. Clone the Repository
2. Install Dependencies:
```
npm install
```
3.Create Token for Authentication:<br>
Run the following command at the terminal:
```
cd jwt 
node token_gen.js
```
go to Postman and send Get request to :http://localhost:8080/generate-token <br>
Grab that token and save it for later use
`Note`:Token is valid for only 1 hour

3. Run the Application:<br>
Run the following command at the terminal:
```
`npm run dev` or <br>
`npm start` <br>
```

5. Access the API: Open your Postman and go to: http://localhost:8080

## Authentication
* Token Generation:

* Users must authenticate via JWT. Tokens should be included in the Authorization header of requests.
```
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```
## Testing
- Use Postman to test the API endpoints.
1 Ensure that you include authentication tokens where required.
